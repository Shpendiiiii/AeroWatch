# AeroWatch

Final Project - ISTE.430

Introduction

The use of aircraft in the military dates back 114 years to when the Wright brothers delivered their first plane to the Signal Corps. From that point forward, the number of military aircraft has increased significantly with an estimated 13300 in the US military alone. As the number of aircraft in the military continues to increase, so does the demand for efficient management and maintenance.

Our company aims to solve this issue by introducing the AeroWatch. The AeroWatch will effectively keep track of aircraft location and their upkeep. Military bases might have only a few aircraft of various capabilities or hundreds of them. Hence, they need to keep track of the aircraft locations, along with the respective maintenance reports. This ensures that the aircraft are ready for day-to-day operations, and are mission-ready at a moment’s notice.

Considering the sensitivity of the project, the product is only intended for US Air Force bases and under special authorization, to her allies.

Competitors:

These are our competitors to our products. All of them have produced software solutions that are exactly or considered to be AeroWatch, whether for civilian or military use:

·       Lockheed Martin

·       Northrop Grumman

·       IBM

·       GE Digital

·       SAP

Even though there is an absence of readily available, public information regarding our competition’s systems, research will be conducted to conclude what the shortcomings of those systems are, and look for space for improvement, which will be integrated with features of the AeroWatch. Some of the already existing features on both sets of systems are:

·       Providing real-time data on the deployment status of each aircraft

·       Maintenance schedule reminders

·       Generating work orders for maintenance and repair tasks

·       Providing tools to manage the budget regarding maintenance and mission readiness

·       Budget forecasting capabilities

·       Aircraft and other related resource allocation capabilities

·       Identifying upcoming maintenance requirements

Significant Challenges

The most significant challenge is security concerns. Given its sensitivity and confidentiality, the data that will be processed and kept in the system is extremely important to national security and needs to be protected from unauthorized access at all costs. This means that maintaining the information security of all data in our system depends critically on adhering to the strictest confidentiality standards, which will be done with the utmost diligence and dedication.

Our final significant challenge will be high availability and reliability. Therefore, there will be a rigorous evaluation of performant programming languages and hardware platforms to build the system. Such an undertaking will ensure that the system is resilient and can continuously operate as a bedrock so that military operations can be carried out without fail.

Gathering Client Requirements

For the AeroWatch to align with our client’s requirements, frequent meetings are needed. This approach allows us to understand their specific requirements and preferences. To enhance our comprehension, we would pose a series of questions:

·           How many types of aircraft are operated in the base?

·           What is the most challenging part of the current management system?

·           How is aircraft maintenance handled in the system?

·           Do you have any specific schedule for the maintenance or routine inspections?

Technical Teams Required:

·           UX/UI Team: ensures the AeroWatch is user-friendly and easy to navigate, creating intuitive interfaces for users.

·           Developers Team: consists of front–end and back-end developers to deliver the UI and the underlying logic.

·           Database Developers Team: they will develop and manage the database infrastructure.

·           Quality assurance Team: they ensure a smooth operation of the AeroWatch; they perform tests to identify and resolve potential issues.

·           Cybersecurity Team: ensure that information security is being upheld, they will deal with security analysis, and penetration testing, making sure that the data is protected.
